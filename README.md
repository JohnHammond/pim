Poetry in Motion (`PIM`)
================

`PIM` is my own endeavor to learn low-level programming and develop a [kernel] or [operating system].

This is entirely for the purpose of experimentation and education; I'll be following along with a lot of information offered by [OSDev.org] and I plan on learning some tips and tricks by looking at the [StewieOS] project, developed by a good friend of mine.

For the time being, I'll use this `README.md` page to archive a list of pages that I would like to read more about through [OSDev.org].
