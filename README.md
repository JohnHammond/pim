`PIM`: Poetry in Motion 
================

`PIM` is my own endeavor to learn low-level programming and develop a [kernel] or [operating system].

This is entirely for the purpose of experimentation and education; I'll be following along with a lot of information offered by [OSDev.org] and I plan on learning some tips and tricks by looking at the [StewieOS] project, developed by a good friend of mine.

For the time being, I'll use this [`README.md`](README.md) page to archive a list of pages that I would like to read more about through [OSDev.org]. 


__Status:__ currently the `gcc_cross_compiler` setup script is working and it will build the cross compiler; but the script should cleaned up. Then we can move on to actually writing the kernel.

Ordered Steps:
--------------

1. [Build newest version](build_new_gcc/) of [`gcc`][gcc].
2. [Create a new gcc cross compiler](gcc_cross_compiler/).
